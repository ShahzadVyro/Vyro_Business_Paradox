get all the schema from it usin cli command


so i am currently manging employee's wrongly and there is no way to manage it with current data as you'll see that some fields can be get from empl info sheet but some from active sheet and for those employee who left company is in resigned/terminated, and if i want to see active and resigend i need to merge active and resigened terminated in to employees data sheet so there are a lot of issues in this xlsx and this is in production meaning we are currently using this for mangement, we need to enhance this, to get atleast single database sheett which has all feilds which i have in the bigquery table atleast also you can see the fields in biguery as well and let me know if those need to be changed as well as i have just added what i thought should be there but i might be wrong or missgin anything or still mangeing it in wrong way!
